What do you see? Take note of how the clusters change from 1953 to 2008. 
You will need to pay attention not only to which countries are in clusters together but also to the Life
Expectancy and BirthRates for those clusters.
	
	In the 1953 clusters the more the birth rate grew the more the life expectancy would drop however gradually.
	In the 2008 clusters the same applied however the life expectancy was much higher the lower the birth rate was with regards to 1953
	in 1953 if the birth rate was 15( per 1000) you would have a life expectancy of around 65
	where as in 2008 under the same circumstances you would have a life expectancy of around 75

	In 1953 the highest life expectancy cluster ranged from only 60 countries and in 2008 the same cluster grew to 91 Countries
	the mid range cluster went from 48(1953) to 43(2008)
	the low range cluster went from 88(1953) to 62(2008)


Run the algorithm with 4 clusters on dataBoth.csv. Note any observations in your text file. Which countries are moving up
clusters? 
	These countries all moved to the first cluster in 2008 from 1953:

	(2008)Portugal, (2008)Puerto Rico, (2008)Qatar, (2008)Reunion, (2008)Romania, (2008)Russia, (2008)Saint Lucia, 
	(2008)Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, (2008)Serbia, (2008)Singapore, (2008)Slovak Republic, (2008)Slovenia, (2008)Spain, (2008)Sri Lanka, 
	(2008)Thailand, (2008)Trinidad and Tobago, (2008)Tunisia, (2008)Turkey, (2008)Ukraine, (2008)United Arab Emirates,(2008)United States, 
	(2008)Uruguay, (2008)Venezuela, (2008)Vietnam, (2008)Virgin Islands (U.S.) 

How does (2008)South Africa” compare to “(1953)United States”? 
	2008 SA: Birth rate: 22 Life expectancy: 51 
	1953 SA: Birth rate: 43 Life expectancy: 45

	1953 US: Birth rate: 24 Life expectancy: 68 
	2008 US: Birth rate: 14 Life expectancy: 77

	In SA, from 1953 to 2008 the population growth dropped to almost half and the life expectancy grew by 6 years,
	while in US, the population growth dropped by 10 and the life expectancy grew by 9 years.
	
	in conclusion in 2008 SA's figures look much like the US's figures looked in 1953. This means that the US life expectancy
	was higher for a large amount of years leading them to not only have a higher population but they are healthier than 
	the average SA citizen.


Are there any 2008 countries that are in a cluster that is made up mostly of 1953 countries? 
Try and explain why. 

Yes there are, in Cluster 2 Afghanistan is the only 2008 country still in cluster 2. 
I assume it is because of the major developments in medical fields that allow us to treat people better,
the countries that already have long life expectancies would gain alot from these developments.
The countries who could not afford these medical developments were left behind causing a major gap 
between cluster 1 and 2 from 1953 to 2008.



Are there any 1953 countries that are in a cluster that is made up of mostly 2008 countries? 
Try and explain why.

yes in cluster 1 there are 10 countries from 1953.
As the previous answer stated, due to medical developments we could enhance the life expectancy of a lot of people 
and this caused a big leap in life expectancy for people who already have a long life expectancy. This caused 
cluster 1 to have a lot of 2008 countries and allow only the very top countries (in life expectancy terms) from 1953
to be part of this cluster.
